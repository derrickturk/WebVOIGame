    <h1>The Two Guy VOI Game</h1>
    <p>God flips a coin with a
      <input type="range" id="successChance" min="0" max="100"
        value="30" step="5">
      <span id="successChanceLabel">30.00</span>% chance of &ldquo;heads&rdquo;.
    <p>If He gets heads, He assigns a payout drawn from a log-normal
      distribution with a mean of
      <input type="range" id="successMean" min="100.0" max="2000.0" value="500">
      $<span id="successMeanLabel">500.00</span> and a P10/P90 ratio of
    <input type="range" id="successRatio" min="1.5" max="10.0"
        value="3.0" step="0.5">
      <span id="successRatioLabel">3.00</span>.
    <p>God offers to sell you the payout, if any, at a cost of
      <input type="range" id="successCost" min="0.0" max="1000.0" value="200.0">
      $<span id="successCostLabel">200.00</span>.

    <p>God's brother, Bob, approaches you and offers yet another deal:
      for a cost of
      <input type="range" id="firstGuyCost" min="0.0" max="200.0" value="10.0">
      $<span id="firstGuyCostLabel">10.00</span>, he will peek at God's coin
      and tell you what he sees before you have to make your decision.
      However, Bob is a known liar: in fact he tells the truth only
      <input type="range" id="firstGuyChance" min="0.0" max="100.0"
        value="60.0">
      <span id="firstGuyChanceLabel">60.00</span>% of the time.

    <p>Finally, God's niece, Sally, approaches you and offers a final deal:
      if and only if you first accept the deal of her father, Bob, Sally will
      also peek at God's coin and relay her findings before you make your final
      decision.
      Sally asks a fee of
      <input type="range" id="secondGuyCost" min="0.0" max="200.0" value="10.0">
      $<span id="secondGuyCostLabel">10.00</span>, but the apple doesn't fall far
      from the tree: she tells the truth only
      <input type="range" id="secondGuyChance" min="0.0" max="100.0"
        value="90.0">
      <span id="secondGuyChanceLabel">90.00</span>% of the time.


    <p>If you accept both Bob and Sally's offers:
    <div id="results">
        <p>On average, you will achieve a net payout of
          $<span id="resultMean">0.00</span>.
        <p>You'll lose money about
          <span id="resultChanceLoss">0.00</span>% of the time.
        <p>You'll lose a bunch of money (more than $100) about
          <span id="resultChanceBigLoss">0.00</span>% of the time.
        <p>You'll gain a bunch of money (more than $1000) about
          <span id="resultChanceBigGain">0.00</span>% of the time.
        <p>Here's the result distribution:
